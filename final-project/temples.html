            <h2>Get to know the California temples</h2>
            <p>California is the first state outside of Utah to have multiple dedicated temples, with a total of 12 currently operating. The first temple built in California was the Los Angeles California Temple, dedicated in 1956. </p>
            <p>The Los Angeles California Temple was the pioneer of temple construction in California, breaking ground for the first temple built within the state.</p>
            <p>After the Salt Lake Temple, the Los Angeles California Temple was the first to feature the iconic angel Moroni statue.</p>
            <p>At the time of its construction, the Los Angeles California Temple was the largest temple of the church.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles California Temple was the last temple designed for live acting of the endowment ceremony.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles California Temple also boasts beautiful hand-painted murals in its ordinance rooms, and it is one of only seven temples where patrons progress through four ordinance rooms before entering the Celestial Room.</p>
